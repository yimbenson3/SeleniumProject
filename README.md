# SeleniumProject


I created this Flight search test in Java with Maven,  I used Eclipse IDE and Selenium Web Driver. 
You can run the code by opening the project in Eclipse and run it as a Java File. 

I also created a test.app  JAR file that you can run on the command line. 
To Run the file:

Step 1 - Download from GitHub and Store on your computer
Step 2 - Open Command Prompt and located the folder of the file
Step 3 - Type in  java -jar testapp .jar 
Step 4 - The Project should be running
